                <h1>The Psychology of Why We Love Dogs</h1>
                <small>Smile Gupta</small>
                <p>
                    We love dogs. Just about all of us do. Big dogs, small dogs,
                    yappy dogs, fluffy dogs, all of them are loveable dogs — we
                    call them pups and puppers, woofers and boofers, pupperinos
                    and cutie-booties, and we adore our closest companions like
                    no other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were to ask a dog owner why they love their dogs so
                    much, they’d probably tell you that they have a close and
                    enduring bond with their dogs, they care about them on a
                    deep level, and know their dogs care about them in return,
                    offering company, love, and an undeniable loyalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the other things they’ll tell you, is that they have
                    a relationship with dogs that they simply can’t have with
                    human beings. This is part of what makes dogs so loveable,
                    their differences from humans.
